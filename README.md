# SmartKeyboarding

This is a simple little browser extension (Safari only at the moment) to enable auto-smart-quotes and other small typographic niceties while typing in text boxes of any sort.

*Note this is pretty early stage and experimental; it needs some work to really be worth distributing widely. See [the issue list](https://github.com/Mr0grog/SmartKeyboarding/issues). Feel free to file new issues or contribute!*
